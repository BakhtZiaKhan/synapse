# ✅ Local Whisper Setup Complete!

## What's Been Set Up

### 1. **Local Whisper Installation** ✅
- ✅ Whisper is installed and working locally
- ✅ All dependencies (torch, librosa, numpy) are installed
- ✅ Test script confirms everything is working

### 2. **Backend Configuration** ✅
- ✅ Updated `backend/app/services/ai_service.py` to use local Whisper
- ✅ Added `USE_LOCAL_WHISPER=true` to `backend/.env`
- ✅ Updated `backend/requirements.txt` with necessary packages
- ✅ Added thread pool for non-blocking Whisper processing

### 3. **Environment Configuration** ✅
- ✅ `backend/.env` configured for local processing
- ✅ `frontend/.env.local` configured for local backend

## How It Works

### **Local Processing Flow:**
1. User uploads audio/video file through frontend
2. Backend receives file and saves it temporarily
3. **Local Whisper** processes the audio file (no external API calls)
4. Transcript is generated locally
5. Results are saved to database

### **Configuration:**
- `USE_LOCAL_WHISPER=true` - Uses local Whisper model
- `USE_LOCAL_WHISPER=false` - Uses Hugging Face API (fallback)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **1. Start the Backend Server**
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### **2. Start the Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### **3. Test with Audio Files**
- Upload audio files (mp3, wav, m4a) or video files (mp4)
- Watch the backend logs to see local Whisper processing
- Check the frontend for results

## 📊 Performance Notes

### **Local Whisper Benefits:**
- ✅ No external API dependencies
- ✅ No API rate limits
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Faster processing for small files
- ✅ No data sent to external services

### **Local Whisper Considerations:**
- ⚠️ Uses more CPU/memory
- ⚠️ Initial model loading takes time
- ⚠️ Requires sufficient RAM (2GB+ recommended)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If you get memory errors:**
- Use a smaller Whisper model: Change `"base"` to `"tiny"` in `ai_service.py`
- Close other applications to free up RAM

### **If processing is slow:**
- This is normal for the first few files (model warming up)
- Subsequent files will be faster

### **If you want to switch back to remote API:**
- Set `USE_LOCAL_WHISPER=false` in `backend/.env`
- Configure your Hugging Face Space URLs

## 📝 Current Status

- ✅ **Backend APIs**: Fully implemented
- ✅ **Frontend**: Configured and ready
- ✅ **Local Whisper**: Working and tested
- ✅ **Database**: Ready (in-memory or Supabase)
- ⏳ **LLM Analysis**: Still needs Hugging Face Space or local model

## 🎯 What's Working Now

You can now:
1. Upload audio/video files
2. Get transcriptions using local Whisper
3. View results in the frontend
4. Store meeting data (in-memory for now)

The only remaining piece is the LLM analysis (summary, action items, key decisions) which still needs either:
- A Hugging Face Space for the LLM
- A local LLM model (more complex setup)

**Your Synapse meeting assistant is ready for transcription!** 🎉
